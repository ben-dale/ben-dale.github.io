          <description>The COVID-19 breakout has resulted in me working from home for the foreseeable, which means I&amp;rsquo;m using the work VPN more than I&amp;rsquo;m used to. Typically I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use the work VPN as I tend to work in the office most of the time but being at home has me flipping in and out of the VPN a couple of times a day. One thing I keep forgetting about the VPN is whether I&amp;rsquo;m on it or not.</description>

          <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Mr-Robot, a VulnHub box created by Leon Johnson.
Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Based on the show, Mr Robot. This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. Your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find. The VM isn&amp;#39;t too difficult. There isn&amp;#39;t any advanced exploitation or reverse engineering. The level is considered beginner-intermediate. Once I found out what IP the box was running on I scanned the ports using nmap:</description>

          <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Nightfall, a VulnHub box created by whitecr0wz, which is part of the Sunset series.
Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Nightfall is a born2root VM designed for beginners. Virtualbox is strongly recommended for doing this challenge. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to go off there so I ran a port scan using nmap to see what was running:
kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/nightfall/nmap$ nmap -sV -sC -oA nmap 10.0.2.19 Starting Nmap 7.</description>

          <description>This weekend I managed to fully root a VulnHub box without looking at another person&amp;rsquo;s write-up for a hint, for the first time! This box was created by Daniel Solstad and can be downloaded here. Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up.
Write-up The description for this box states:
Eric is trying to reach out on the Internet, but is he following best practice? Flags: - /root/flag.txt - /home/eric/flag.txt Once I had Eric set up and running I ran a port scan:</description>

          <description>A few years ago I came across a clock design that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. I thought the design was pretty cool and I wondered how hard it would be to build a webpage that would display similar wording that highlights to display the current time.
I got to work hacking around, figuring out how to translate time in numbers to time in text. After a couple of hours I had something I was fairly happy with.</description>
