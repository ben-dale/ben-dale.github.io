      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for ColddBox, a CTF challenge created by C0ldd.
Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
Two ports were open: HTTP on port 80 and SSH on 4512.
Wordpress was running on port 80, and given its proclivity for vulnerabilities, I started scanning the IP with gobuster.
gobuster identified a page under &amp;ldquo;/hidden&amp;rdquo; which exposed some important information:
 C0ldd, you changed Hugo&amp;rsquo;s password, when you can send it to him so he can continue uploading his articles.</description>

      <description>A deep dive into some common Docker misconfigurations, exploitations, etc. for learning and reference purposes, using a Ubuntu Server VM called &amp;ldquo;lab&amp;rdquo;.
Disclaimer: I&amp;rsquo;m not a Docker expert, these are just some notes I put together whilst researching Docker security and general usage, for my own interest. The information here is taken from a wide variety of sources.
Disclaimer for the disclaimer: That&amp;rsquo;s smart talk for &amp;ldquo;I just wanted to f*ck about with Docker&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Bounty Hacker, a CTF challenge created by Sevuhl.
Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
 Port 21: vsftpd 3.0.3 Port 22: OpenSSH 7.2p2 Port 80: Apache httpd 2.4.18  I started with the FTP server on port 21 because nmap reported that anonymous login was allowed. There I found two files: &amp;ldquo;task.txt&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;locks.txt&amp;rdquo;.
Given that I had found a potential username and a list of (what looked like) passwords, I had a go at brute-forcing SSH.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Res, a CTF challenge created by stuxnet.
Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
An Apache webserver was accessible on port 80, and on port 6379, Redis. I checked out port 80 which just returned the default Apache webpage. I set up gobuster to scan the server but killed it after five minutes as it didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the right track to be on.</description>

Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
Two ports: SSH on port 22 and Apache on port 80. I took a look first at what was running on port 80.
It was a website that showed you pictures of cats and dogs. Awh how nice. The showing of dogs and cats was controlled by a query parameter in the URL:</description>

Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
I also ran a full port scan but this was the only port open. Node.js running Express, hosting a webpage.
I took a look at the website in my browser and found a fairly simple website with some sort of account functionality.
I followed the link to the login page.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Cloud AV, a VulnHub box created by BoredHackerBlog.
Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Cloud Anti-Virus Scanner! is a cloud-based antivirus scanning service. Currently, it&#39;s in beta mode. You&#39;ve been asked to test the setup and find vulnerabilities and escalate privs. Difficulty: Easy Tasks involved: port scanning webapp attacks sql injection command injection brute forcing code analysis Virtual Machine: Format: Virtual Machine (Virtualbox OVA) Operating System: Linux Networking: DHCP Service: Enabled IP Address Automatically assign This works better with VirtualBox than VMware The listed tasks are exploits I have some familiarity with so I decided that this would be a good box to brush up some techniques.</description>

      <description>The COVID-19 breakout has resulted in me working from home for the foreseeable, which means I&amp;rsquo;m using the work VPN more than I&amp;rsquo;m used to. Typically I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use the work VPN as I tend to work in the office most of the time but being at home has me flipping in and out of the VPN a couple of times a day. One thing I keep forgetting about the VPN is whether I&amp;rsquo;m on it or not.</description>

Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Based on the show, Mr Robot. This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. Your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find. The VM isn&#39;t too difficult. There isn&#39;t any advanced exploitation or reverse engineering. The level is considered beginner-intermediate.

      <description>A few years ago I came across a clock design that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. I thought the design was pretty cool and I wondered how hard it would be to build a webpage that would display similar wording that highlights to display the current time.
I got to work hacking around, figuring out how to translate time in numbers to time in text. After a couple of hours I had something I was fairly happy with.</description>
