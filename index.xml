Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
I also ran a full port scan but this was the only port open. Node.js running Express, hosting a webpage.
I took a look at the website in my browser and found a fairly simple website with some sort of account functionality.
I followed the link to the login page.</description>

Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Cloud Anti-Virus Scanner! is a cloud-based antivirus scanning service. Currently, it&amp;#39;s in beta mode. You&amp;#39;ve been asked to test the setup and find vulnerabilities and escalate privs. Difficulty: Easy Tasks involved: port scanning webapp attacks sql injection command injection brute forcing code analysis Virtual Machine: Format: Virtual Machine (Virtualbox OVA) Operating System: Linux Networking: DHCP Service: Enabled IP Address Automatically assign This works better with VirtualBox than VMware The listed tasks are exploits I have some familiarity with so I decided that this would be a good box to brush up some techniques.</description>

          <description>The COVID-19 breakout has resulted in me working from home for the foreseeable, which means I&amp;rsquo;m using the work VPN more than I&amp;rsquo;m used to. Typically I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use the work VPN as I tend to work in the office most of the time but being at home has me flipping in and out of the VPN a couple of times a day. One thing I keep forgetting about the VPN is whether I&amp;rsquo;m on it or not.</description>

Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Based on the show, Mr Robot. This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. Your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find. The VM isn&amp;#39;t too difficult. There isn&amp;#39;t any advanced exploitation or reverse engineering. The level is considered beginner-intermediate. Once I found out what IP the box was running on I scanned the ports using nmap:</description>

Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Nightfall is a born2root VM designed for beginners. Virtualbox is strongly recommended for doing this challenge. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to go off there so I ran a port scan using nmap to see what was running:

          <description>A few years ago I came across a clock design that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. I thought the design was pretty cool and I wondered how hard it would be to build a webpage that would display similar wording that highlights to display the current time.
I got to work hacking around, figuring out how to translate time in numbers to time in text. After a couple of hours I had something I was fairly happy with.</description>
