          <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Nightfall, a VulnHub box created by whitecr0wz, which is part of the Sunset series.
Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Nightfall is a born2root VM designed for beginners. Virtualbox is strongly recommended for doing this challenge. There wasn&amp;rsquo;t much to go off there so I ran a port scan using nmap to see what was running:
