      <description>A deep dive into JSON Web Tokens: what they are, how they&amp;rsquo;re structured, and more specifically, common misconfigurations and exploits.
A JWT JWTs are a core part of the OpenID Connect standard: a standard which extends the identity layer on top of OAuth 2.
Whilst the OAuth 2 specification does not stipulate a format for access tokens, the industry has widely adopted the use of JWTs.
JWTs are considered stateless. The authorization server does not need to maintain a list of valid JWTs as JWTs are signed using a cryptographic signature which can be checked each time a JWT is used.</description>

Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
I took a quick look at what was running on port 80 but as suspected it was the default apache install page. Port 8080 however was running some sort of image gallery CMS system.
I took a look at the source code for the page and found a couple of potential interesting rabbit holes to go down: a commented out &amp;ldquo;forgot-password.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for ColddBox, a CTF challenge created by C0ldd.
Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
Two ports were open: HTTP on port 80 and SSH on 4512.
Wordpress was running on port 80, and given its proclivity for vulnerabilities, I started scanning the IP with gobuster.
gobuster identified a page under &amp;ldquo;/hidden&amp;rdquo; which exposed some important information:
 C0ldd, you changed Hugo&amp;rsquo;s password, when you can send it to him so he can continue uploading his articles.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Bounty Hacker, a CTF challenge created by Sevuhl.
Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
 Port 21: vsftpd 3.0.3 Port 22: OpenSSH 7.2p2 Port 80: Apache httpd 2.4.18  I started with the FTP server on port 21 because nmap reported that anonymous login was allowed. There I found two files: &amp;ldquo;task.txt&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;locks.txt&amp;rdquo;.
Given that I had found a potential username and a list of (what looked like) passwords, I had a go at brute-forcing SSH.</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Res, a CTF challenge created by stuxnet.
Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
An Apache webserver was accessible on port 80, and on port 6379, Redis. I checked out port 80 which just returned the default Apache webpage. I set up gobuster to scan the server but killed it after five minutes as it didn&amp;rsquo;t find anything, and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure this wasn&amp;rsquo;t the right track to be on.</description>

Typically I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use the work VPN as I tend to work in the office most of the time but being at home has me flipping in and out of the VPN a couple of times a day. One thing I keep forgetting about the VPN is whether I&amp;rsquo;m on it or not.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I came across a clock design that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. I thought the design was pretty cool and I wondered how hard it would be to build a webpage that would display similar wording that highlights to display the current time.
I got to work hacking around, figuring out how to translate time in numbers to time in text. After a couple of hours I had something I was fairly happy with.</description>
