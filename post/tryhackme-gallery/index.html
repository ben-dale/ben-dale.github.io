    <p>Here&rsquo;s my write-up for <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/gallery666">Gallery</a>, a CTF challenge created by <a href="https://twitter.com/mika_sec">Mikaa</a>.</p>
<h3 id="write-up">Write-up</h3>
<p>I deployed the box using TryHackMe&rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using <code>nmap</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I took a quick look at what was running on port <code>80</code> but as suspected it was the default apache install page. Port <code>8080</code> however was running some sort of image gallery CMS system.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I took a look at the source code for the page and found a couple of potential interesting rabbit holes to go down: a commented out &ldquo;forgot-password.html&rdquo; reference and a &ldquo;create_account.php&rdquo; reference.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>These, unfortunately, didn&rsquo;t lead anywhere interesting: <code>forgot-password.html</code> returned a 404 response, and <code>create_account.php</code> returned an empty page showing the string &ldquo;disabled&rdquo;. I spent a couple of minutes trying to mess with URL query parameters to see if I could enable the <code>create_account.php</code> page, but no luck.</p>
<p>Back on the login page, I took a look at the request that was made when a user tried to log in and saw that the response contained the SQL query that was executed:</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I captured this request using Burp so that I could play around a little more with it and found that it was vulnerable to an SQL injection attack.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I used the same attack in my browser, entering <code>admin'or'a'='a</code> as the username, and I was in.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This application allows a user to create galleries and upload image files to those galleries. I wondered if I could upload a malicious file and get the application to execute the code in it. I saw from a scan I was running in the background that an &ldquo;uploads&rdquo; directory was found, which presumably was where the uploaded files were stored.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I opened a gallery and uploaded a reverse shell file to it, with the hopes of executing the code via the uploads page. This turned out to be unnecessary because the reverse shell was executed when I refreshed the gallery page.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/13.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now that I was on the machine, I started looking for config files that might contain passwords and found <code>initialize.php</code> which contained a database username and password.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>One of the flags for this machine was to find the admin user&rsquo;s hashed password:</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/16.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/17.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I then moved to enumerate the entire machine. To speed up the process I used <a href="https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS">linPEAS</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/18.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Thankfully, <code>mike</code> had left their password in a history file that <code>linPEAS</code> was able to find.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">╔══════════╣ Searching passwords in history files
...
sudo -lb3stpassw0rdbr0xx
sudo -l
</code></pre></div><p><img src="/static/gallery/19.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now that I had access to <code>mike</code>&rsquo;s account, I could look around the contents of their home directory, and came across a file containing usernames and passwords. I tried these passwords for the <code>root</code> user, but no luck.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/21.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I ran <code>linPEAS</code> again, this time as <code>mike</code>, and found that <code>mike</code> was able to run a shell script as <code>root</code>, without a password.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-shell" data-lang="shell">User mike may run the following commands on gallery:
    <span style="color:#f92672">(</span>root<span style="color:#f92672">)</span> NOPASSWD: /bin/bash /opt/rootkit.sh
</code></pre></div><p>I took a look at the contents of <code>rootkit.sh</code> and noticed that <code>nano</code> could be executed. I remembered that there was <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nano/#sudo">a trick</a> to initialize a shell from inside <code>nano</code> which would effectively give us access to the <code>root</code> user.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/22.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For this, I had to upgrade my shell, so that <code>nano</code> would run.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/23.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once that was done, I executed <code>rootkit.sh</code>, entered &ldquo;read&rdquo; when prompted, and executed the commands from within <code>nano</code> to initialize a shell.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/24.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/25.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I could now execute commands as the <code>root</code> user.</p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/26.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/gallery/27.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve had a chance to sit down and work through a box. This was a fairly easy box to attack, and I recommend it to anyone as a smaller, bite-sized alternative to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/">Juice Shop</a>. Thanks Mikaa!</p>
