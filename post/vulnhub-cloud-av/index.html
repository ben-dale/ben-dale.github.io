    <p>Here&rsquo;s my write-up for <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/boredhackerblog-cloud-av,453/">Cloud AV</a>, a VulnHub box created by <a href="http://www.boredhackerblog.info/">BoredHackerBlog</a>.</p>
<h3 id="write-up">Write-up</h3>
<p>The description for this box states the following:</p>
<pre><code>Cloud Anti-Virus Scanner! is a cloud-based antivirus scanning service.

Currently, it's in beta mode. You've been asked to test the setup and find vulnerabilities and escalate privs.

Difficulty: Easy

Tasks involved:
    port scanning
    webapp attacks
    sql injection
    command injection
    brute forcing
    code analysis

Virtual Machine:
    Format: Virtual Machine (Virtualbox OVA)
    Operating System: Linux

Networking:
    DHCP Service: Enabled
    IP Address Automatically assign


This works better with VirtualBox than VMware 
</code></pre><p>The listed tasks are exploits I have some familiarity with so I decided that this would be a good box to brush up some techniques.</p>
<p>Once I found out what IP the box was running on I scanned the ports using <code>nmap</code>:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/borderhackerblog/cloud_av$ nmap -sC -sV 192.168.1.245

</code></pre><p><code>nmap</code> found two ports open: <code>22</code> and <code>8080</code>. I took a look at <code>8080</code> first.</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The page returned on port <code>8080</code> shows a message asking for an invite code so that you can gain access to the system and &ldquo;start testing&rdquo;. I managed to invoke an error page, inputting a single double quote-mark:</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking closely at the error message, I could see the underlying SQL query:</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It was possible to bypass this screen and gain an active session using the input: <code>&quot; or 1=1 -- -</code></p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once I had access I was redirected to a <code>/scan</code> page that prompted me for some input.</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After playing around with this input form for a couple of minutes I decided to have a look at the request in Burp.</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Given the input for this request, and the output of the response I presumed this request was running shell commands under the hood. I verified this by throwing different commands at the endpoint until one returned something interesting:</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I had executed <code>pwd</code> on the box. To confirm this (and to see how far I could push this) I used <code>netcat</code> to listen out for incoming connections on port <code>8000</code> on my machine (<code>nc -lvp 8000</code>) and attempted to make a call back to my machine from this injection point.</p>
<p>I used Burp to send another request, with the payload: <code>nc 192.168.1.249 8000</code> and saw that a connection was made from the box:</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although I had verified that connections could be made back to my machine I still didn&rsquo;t have a reverse shell. After trying several different reverse shell payloads I managed to get a python reverse shell working:</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I was logged in as user <code>scanner</code>. I had a quick look around on the box and then moved to the home directory of <code>scanner</code> to find out what was there.</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking closely at the output of <code>ls -l</code> above I could see that <code>update_cloudav</code> ran as root, as the SUID bit was set and the owner was <code>root</code>. The source code for <code>update_cloudav</code> was also made available in <code>update_cloudav.c</code>.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    char *freshclam=&quot;/usr/bin/freshclam&quot;;

    if (argc &lt; 2){
        printf(&quot;This tool lets you update antivirus rules\nPlease supply command line arguments for freshclam\n&quot;);
        return 1;
    }

    char *command = malloc(strlen(freshclam) + strlen(argv[1]) + 2);
    sprintf(command, &quot;%s %s&quot;, freshclam, argv[1]);
    setgid(0);
    setuid(0);
    system(command);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre><p>Here, the <code>system</code> method will run whatever is in the <code>command</code> variable as <code>root</code>. The goal was to inject a malicious shell command into <code>command</code>.</p>
<p>I tried a couple of different things but I quickly got bored with the crappy reverse shell. I remembered that port <code>22</code> was open and decided to generate an ssh key for user <code>scanner</code> and log in over ssh, so I didn&rsquo;t drop the reverse shell every time I cmd+C&rsquo;d.</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I copied the private key on to my machine and had to change some perms on the key so that I could use it:</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I also forgot to write the public key to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file on the <code>scanner</code> user. After doing that I logged in as <code>scanner</code> over ssh.</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This probably wasn&rsquo;t necessary in the long run but hey, installing backdoors is interesting.</p>
<p>After reading a couple of blog posts on how <code>system</code> shouldn&rsquo;t be used (for security reasons) I looked back at the code for <code>update_cloudav</code> and identified an injection point:</p>
<pre><code>sprintf(command, &quot;%s %s&quot;, freshclam, argv[1]);
</code></pre><p>Messing around with the quote marks using the input that I controlled (<code>argv[1]</code>) in the above command allowed me to run a command as root:</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Once I had confirmed I could run commands as <code>root</code> I entered a slightly more nefarious payload&hellip;</p>
<p><img src="/static/cloudav/16.png" alt=""></p>
<p>and root access was gained. I had a quick look around for some flags but didn&rsquo;t find any in the usual places, but considering I had root access I decided that this box was &ldquo;done&rdquo;.</p>
