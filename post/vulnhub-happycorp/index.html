| + Average beginner/intermediate VM, only a few twists   |
|   + May find it easy/hard (depends on YOUR background)  |
|   + ...also which way you attack the box                |
|                                                         |
| + It SHOULD work on VMware                              |
|   + REBOOT the VM if you CHANGE network modes           |
|   + Fusion users, you'll need to retry when importing   |

<p>Scrolling down the page a bit I came across some interesting information:</p>

</code></pre><p>I noted down these names and e-mail addresses. I also added <code>happycorp.local</code> to my <code>/etc/hosts</code> incase anything was using <code>happycorp.local</code> to resolve something.</p>
<p>I also came across a contact form but this didn&rsquo;t look to be hooked up:</p>

<p>Whilst I was clicking around I had <code>nikto</code> and <code>dirb</code> running in the background. Once I had finished looking around I took a look at what <code>dirb</code> and <code>nikto</code> had found.</p>

</code></pre><p>Both <code>nikto</code> and <code>dirb</code> found <code>admin.php</code>, and <code>dirb</code> also found <code>cms.php</code> but I imagined (given the 302) that you needed a session to view this page.</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I took a look at the page source and found a helpful bit of information left by Rodney:</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I went with the presumption that the admin credentials were hardcoded in <code>admin.php</code>. I tried the usual <code>admin:admin</code>, waited a few seconds (which I thought was odd, it shouldn&rsquo;t be this slow, especially given the comment) and was greeted with an interesting error message:</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Did this mean that I could enumerate usernames? I tried some of the names I captured before (heather, carolyn, rodney and jennifer). Attemping to log in with &ldquo;heather&rdquo; returned a different error message this time:</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After trying several passwords I set up <code>hydra</code> to brute force this login form. I gave it a couple of minutes, leaving <code>hydra</code> to do its thing, and given that I was now at a dead-end, I moved onto NFS running on port 2049.</p>
<p>Running <code>showmount</code> returned the NFS server&rsquo;s export list, which only contained one thing:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~$ sudo showmount -e 192.168.1.189
Export list for 192.168.1.189:
/home/karl *
</code></pre><p>This exposes user <code>karl</code>. I created an empty folder and mounted the share:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~$ mkdir /tmp/NFS
kali@kali:~$ sudo mount 192.168.1.189:/ /tmp/NFS
kali@kali:~$ cd /tmp/NFS/home/karl
kali@kali:/tmp/NFS/home/karl$ ls -al

</code></pre><p>I tried to <code>cd</code> into <code>.ssh</code> and got a permissions error, which made sense in my head&hellip; and then a few seconds later it didn&rsquo;t make sense. Given my rudimentary knowledge of NFS I wondered how NFS enforces file permissions when you mount a share on a different machine, with a different set of users. Could this be messed with somehow? I did some research and came across <a href="https://pentestacademy.wordpress.com/2017/09/20/nfs/">this article</a> which backed up my thinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If there are any files on the exported share that the user doesn’t have permission to read them then it might be possible to trick the NFS server to believe that the user account that tries to read the file is the owner of the file. This can be achieved by performing UID (User ID) manipulation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I created a user on my machine named &ldquo;karl&rdquo; with the UID of 1001 and switched to <code>karl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:/tmp/NFS/home/karl$ su karl
$ ls -al

drwxr-xr-x 3 karl karl 4096 Mar  5  2019 .

-rw-r--r-- 1 karl karl  675 Mar  4  2019 .profile
drwx------ 2 karl karl 4096 Mar  5  2019 .ssh
</code></pre><p>The <code>1001</code>'s had changed to <code>karl</code>'s. I tried to <code>cd</code> into <code>.ssh</code> again and it worked!</p>
<pre><code>$ cd .ssh
$ ls -al
total 24

-rw-r--r-- 1 karl karl  740 Mar  4  2019 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 karl karl   18 Mar  4  2019 user.txt
</code></pre><p>This is also how I found the first flag:</p>
<pre><code>$ cat user.txt
flag1{Z29vZGJveQ}
</code></pre><p>I planned to create another ssh keypair that I controlled and to add the public key to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file in karl&rsquo;s home directory, but I only had read permissions for the entire share. The next plan was to make a copy of the private key (id_rsa) and use that to ssh in as karl.</p>
<pre><code># As karl
$ cp id_rsa /home/kali/Documents/vulnhub/happycorp1

# Back to kali user
kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/happycorp1$ ssh karl@192.168.1.189 -i id_rsa
Enter passphrase for key 'id_rsa':
</code></pre><p>The private key was protected by a password. Cracking this with <code>john</code> thankfully didn&rsquo;t take too long. I used <code>ssh2john.py</code> to hash the private key and used the rockyou wordlist to crack the password:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/happycorp1$ /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa id_rsa.hash
</code></pre><p><img src="/static/happycorp/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I ssh&rsquo;d in as karl and had to wait a few seconds whilst some weird error messages appeared:</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After searching around for some explanation I came to a conclusion that either rbash or bash (or something) was stuck in a loop. I couldn&rsquo;t exit but after some keyboard smashing (lots of Ctrl+C and <code>exit</code>s) I got into a working <code>rbash</code> shell. I couldn&rsquo;t <code>cd</code> around but that didn&rsquo;t stop me from looking at files using their full path. I wanted to take a look at <code>admin.php</code> to confirm my earlier presumptions about the hardcoded password (plus hydra still hadn&rsquo;t found the password):</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The slowness that I experienced when I was trying to log into the admin page now made sense given the <code>sleep(3)</code>. The password also was hardcoded as suggested by Rodney&rsquo;s comment.</p>
<p>I logged in to the admin page using the now retrieved credentials but I didn&rsquo;t find much, just a few passive-aggressive remarks by Rodney in a barely functional CMS:</p>
<p><code>cms.php</code>:
<img src="/static/happycorp/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>home.php</code>:
<img src="/static/happycorp/12.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>backup.php</code>:
<img src="/static/happycorp/13.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This avenue didn&rsquo;t lead anywhere so I shifted my attention back to the access I had to karl&rsquo;s account. I downloaded a copy of <a href="https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/blob/master/LinEnum.sh">LinEnum</a> to karl&rsquo;s home directory but rbash didn&rsquo;t let me run it. I backed out and ssh&rsquo;d in again, this time using <code>-t</code> to force a shell.</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/happycorp1$ ssh karl@192.168.1.189 -i id_rsa -t /bin/sh
</code></pre><p>This worked and I now had a basic unrestricted shell to mess around with. I ran <code>LinEnum</code> which found that <code>cp</code> had a SUID bit set:</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I verified this by making a copy of <code>/etc/shadow</code> and viewing it:</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t get access to root&rsquo;s home directory, but given the location of the user flag I assumed the root flag would be somewhere similar, with the name &ldquo;root.txt&rdquo;:</p>
<p><img src="/static/happycorp/16.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Although I had the flag I still didn&rsquo;t have full root-level access, so to finish the job I made a copy of <code>/etc/passwd</code> and added the following line:</p>
<pre><code>hacker::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
</code></pre><p>I had to copy the copy of <code>/etc/passwd</code> to my local machine (using <code>python -m http.server</code>) so that I could edit it. This was because <code>cp</code> has the SUID bit set and the copy of <code>/etc/passwd</code> has read-only root privilege so I couldn&rsquo;t edit it on the box. Once I made the edit I used the same method to copy the edited <code>/etc/passwd</code> file back to HappyCorp (<code>python -m http.server</code> from my machine and <code>wget</code> from the HappyCorp box) and overwrote the passwd file under <code>/etc</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ cp passwd /etc/passwd
</code></pre><p><img src="/static/happycorp/17.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I enjoyed HappyCorp a lot. I was left scratching my head a couple of times but with the right amount of research, I managed to get to the root flag. Thanks for the challenge Zayotic!</p>
