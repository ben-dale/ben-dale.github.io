      <description>The COVID-19 breakout has resulted in me working from home for the foreseeable, which means I&amp;rsquo;m using the work VPN more than I&amp;rsquo;m used to. Typically I don&amp;rsquo;t have to use the work VPN as I tend to work in the office most of the time but being at home has me flipping in and out of the VPN a couple of times a day. One thing I keep forgetting about the VPN is whether I&amp;rsquo;m on it or not.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I came across a clock design that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t seen before. I thought the design was pretty cool and I wondered how hard it would be to build a webpage that would display similar wording that highlights to display the current time.
I got to work hacking around, figuring out how to translate time in numbers to time in text. After a couple of hours I had something I was fairly happy with.</description>
