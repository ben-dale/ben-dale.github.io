      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for CI/CD Goat, a purposely vulnerable CI/CD environment with a set of CTF challenges, created by Cider.
Write-up I deployed the environment on my machine using the instructions from the project&amp;rsquo;s readme:
curl -o cicd-goat/docker-compose.yaml --create-dirs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cider-security-research/cicd-goat/main/docker-compose.yaml cd cicd-goat &amp;amp;&amp;amp; docker compose up -d There are 10 challenges in total, each inspired by Alice in Wonderland.

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Bounty Hacker, a CTF challenge created by Sevuhl.
Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
 Port 21: vsftpd 3.0.3 Port 22: OpenSSH 7.2p2 Port 80: Apache httpd 2.4.18  I started with the FTP server on port 21 because nmap reported that anonymous login was allowed. There I found two files: &amp;ldquo;task.txt&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;locks.txt&amp;rdquo;.
Given that I had found a potential username and a list of (what looked like) passwords, I had a go at brute-forcing SSH.</description>
