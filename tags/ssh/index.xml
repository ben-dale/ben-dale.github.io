      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Bounty Hacker, a CTF challenge created by Sevuhl.
Write-up I deployed the box using TryHackMe&amp;rsquo;s interface and scanned the host using nmap:
 Port 21: vsftpd 3.0.3 Port 22: OpenSSH 7.2p2 Port 80: Apache httpd 2.4.18  I started with the FTP server on port 21 because nmap reported that anonymous login was allowed. There I found two files: &amp;ldquo;task.txt&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;locks.txt&amp;rdquo;.
Given that I had found a potential username and a list of (what looked like) passwords, I had a go at brute-forcing SSH.</description>
