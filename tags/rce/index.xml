      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s my write-up for Cloud AV, a VulnHub box created by BoredHackerBlog.
Write-up The description for this box states the following:
Cloud Anti-Virus Scanner! is a cloud-based antivirus scanning service. Currently, it&#39;s in beta mode. You&#39;ve been asked to test the setup and find vulnerabilities and escalate privs. Difficulty: Easy Tasks involved: port scanning webapp attacks sql injection command injection brute forcing code analysis Virtual Machine: Format: Virtual Machine (Virtualbox OVA) Operating System: Linux Networking: DHCP Service: Enabled IP Address Automatically assign This works better with VirtualBox than VMware  The listed tasks are exploits I have some familiarity with so I decided that this would be a good box to brush up some techniques.</description>
