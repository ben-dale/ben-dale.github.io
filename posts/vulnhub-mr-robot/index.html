This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. Your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find. The VM isn't too difficult.

After a few different attempts I came across a copy of nmap that had a SUID flag set and was owned by root:\nI found out that nmap has an interactive mode that lets you drop down into a shell, which is how I got a root shell:\nI took a look at /root and my assumptions were validated; I had the final key:\nFinal thoughts I‚Äôd been meaning to take a look at this box for a while, given I‚Äôm a big fan of the TV show. I had a lot of fun finding the different keys and it was a good box for me to practice some exploits I‚Äôd previously learned about and used on other boxes. Thanks Leon üëç\n",

<h3 id="write-up">Write-up<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#write-up">#</a></h3>
<p>The description for this box states the following:</p>
<pre><code>Based on the show, Mr Robot. 
This VM has three keys hidden in different locations. Your goal is to find all three. Each key is progressively difficult to find. 
The VM isn't too difficult. There isn't any advanced exploitation or reverse engineering. The level is considered beginner-intermediate.
</code></pre><p>Once I found out what IP the box was running on I scanned the ports using <code>nmap</code>:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/mrrobot$ nmap -sC -sV -oA ports 192.168.1.206

</code></pre><p>Port 22 was closed which is a shame, but 80 and 443 were open. I had a quick look at the SSL certificate but didn&rsquo;t find anything useful and stuck to port 80 for the entirety of this CTF.</p>
<p>I opened up Firefox and had a look at what was running on port 80:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/1.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p><code>prepare</code>, <code>fsociety</code> and <code>wakeup</code> played a small video clip from the Mr Robot TV show. <code>inform</code> and <code>question</code> showed two different galleries of images, one containing newspaper clippings and a running dialogue by Mr Robot himself, and another containing Banksy-style art.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/2.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p><code>join</code> opened up a new page where Mr Robot asked me for my e-mail address, although the request that backed this question didn&rsquo;t lead anywhere:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/3.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>After some initial manual investigation of the website I ran <code>nikto</code> to see what it could find, and it identified the website as running on WordPress:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/mrrobot$ nikto -host http://192.168.1.206

+ /wordpress: A Wordpress installation was found.
+ /wp-admin/wp-login.php: Wordpress login found

</code></pre><p>I ran <code>wpscan</code> to find out a little bit more information:</p>
<pre><code>kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/mrrobot$ wpscan --url http://192.168.1.206
...
[+] http://192.168.1.206/robots.txt
 | Found By: Robots Txt (Aggressive Detection)
 | Confidence: 100%
...
</code></pre><p><code>wpscan</code> didn&rsquo;t find anything particularly interesting, but it did identify <code>robots.txt</code> so I took a look:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/4.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>The first key was found:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/5.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I then downloaded <code>fsocity.dic</code> and took a look at the contents. After looking at the raw data to verify it was indeed a dictionary, I counted the entries, checked if there were any duplicates (which there were) and deduplicated the file:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/6.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I assumed that I&rsquo;d been given this dictionary for a reason, then remembered the wp-admin page. I still didn&rsquo;t have a username so I started with a few names from the TV show and I got a different error message back when I tried &ldquo;elliot&rdquo;:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/7.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Now that I had a username and a clean dictionary file, I decided to use <code>wpscan</code>&rsquo;s brute-force option to crack Elliot&rsquo;s account:</p>
<pre><code>wpscan -U elliot -P no_dupes.dic --url 192.168.1.206 --password-attack wp-login
</code></pre><p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/8.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Success! I logged into Elliot&rsquo;s account and looked around for any draft posts, media, comments, anything that might be hiding a key. I looked at the list of users and found a second user:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/9.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Looking at the info for this second user I found a potential hint at a key, but this didn&rsquo;t lead anywhere:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/10.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>When I couldn&rsquo;t find anything interesting I shifted my attention to the installed plugins, with the hopes of creating a reverse shell. None of the installed plugins were active, so I activated HelloDolly and edited the PHP to call back to my machine, which I had set up listening for a connection using netcat:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/11.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I executed the script by hitting http://192.168.1.206/wp-content/plugins/hello.php in Firefox and a couple of seconds later I had a shell:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/12.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p><code>/etc/passwd</code> listed the user &ldquo;robot&rdquo;. I decided to check out the home directory of &ldquo;robot&rdquo; which luckily was readable and found a couple of interesting files:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/13.png" alt=""  />

<p>I didn&rsquo;t have read permissions for <code>key-2-of-3.txt</code> but I did for <code>password.raw-md5</code>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/15.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I decided to try and crack this password using an online tool first before using <code>john</code>, but thankfully it was an easy password to crack:</p>

</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/17.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>Now that I was logged in as &ldquo;robot&rdquo; I could read the second key file:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/18.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I assumed that the final key would only be accessible to &ldquo;root&rdquo; so I started on some privilege escalation techniques. After a few different attempts I came across a copy of <code>nmap</code> that had a SUID flag set and was owned by root:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/19.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I found out that <code>nmap</code> has an interactive mode that lets you drop down into a shell, which is how I got a root shell:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/static/mrrobot/20.png" alt=""  />
</p>
<p>I took a look at <code>/root</code> and my assumptions were validated; I had the final key:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d been meaning to take a look at this box for a while, given I&rsquo;m a big fan of the TV show. I had a lot of fun finding the different keys and it was a good box for me to practice some exploits I&rsquo;d previously learned about and used on other boxes. Thanks Leon üëç</p>
