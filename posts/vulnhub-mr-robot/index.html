</code></pre></div><p>Port 22 was closed which is a shame, but 80 and 443 were open. I had a quick look at the SSL certificate but didn&rsquo;t find anything useful and stuck to port 80 for the entirety of this CTF.</p>
<p>I opened up Firefox and had a look at what was running on port 80:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>prepare</code>, <code>fsociety</code> and <code>wakeup</code> played a small video clip from the Mr Robot TV show. <code>inform</code> and <code>question</code> showed two different galleries of images, one containing newspaper clippings and a running dialogue by Mr Robot himself, and another containing Banksy-style art.</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>join</code> opened up a new page where Mr Robot asked me for my e-mail address, although the request that backed this question didn&rsquo;t lead anywhere:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>After some initial manual investigation of the website I ran <code>nikto</code> to see what it could find, and it identified the website as running on WordPress:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/mrrobot$ nikto -host http://192.168.1.206

+ /wordpress: A Wordpress installation was found.
+ /wp-admin/wp-login.php: Wordpress login found
...
</code></pre></div><p>I ran <code>wpscan</code> to find out a little bit more information:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">kali@kali:~/Documents/vulnhub/mrrobot$ wpscan --url http://192.168.1.206

 | Confidence: 100%

</code></pre></div><p><code>wpscan</code> didn&rsquo;t find anything particularly interesting, but it did identify <code>robots.txt</code> so I took a look:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The first key was found:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I then downloaded <code>fsocity.dic</code> and took a look at the contents. After looking at the raw data to verify it was indeed a dictionary, I counted the entries, checked if there were any duplicates (which there were) and deduplicated the file:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I assumed that I&rsquo;d been given this dictionary for a reason, then remembered the wp-admin page. I still didn&rsquo;t have a username so I started with a few names from the TV show and I got a different error message back when I tried &ldquo;elliot&rdquo;:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now that I had a username and a clean dictionary file, I decided to use <code>wpscan</code>'s brute-force option to crack Elliot&rsquo;s account:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">wpscan -U elliot -P no_dupes.dic --url 192.168.1.206 --password-attack wp-login
</code></pre></div><p><img src="/static/mrrobot/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Success! I logged into Elliot&rsquo;s account and looked around for any draft posts, media, comments, anything that might be hiding a key. I looked at the list of users and found a second user:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Looking at the info for this second user I found a potential hint at a key, but this didn&rsquo;t lead anywhere:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>When I couldn&rsquo;t find anything interesting I shifted my attention to the installed plugins, with the hopes of creating a reverse shell. None of the installed plugins were active, so I activated HelloDolly and edited the PHP to call back to my machine, which I had set up listening for a connection using netcat:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I executed the script by hitting http://192.168.1.206/wp-content/plugins/hello.php in Firefox and a couple of seconds later I had a shell:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/12.png" alt=""></p>
<p><code>/etc/passwd</code> listed the user &ldquo;robot&rdquo;. I decided to check out the home directory of &ldquo;robot&rdquo; which luckily was readable and found a couple of interesting files:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/13.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/14.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t have read permissions for <code>key-2-of-3.txt</code> but I did for <code>password.raw-md5</code>:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/15.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I decided to try and crack this password using an online tool first before using <code>john</code>, but thankfully it was an easy password to crack:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/16.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/17.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now that I was logged in as &ldquo;robot&rdquo; I could read the second key file:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/18.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I assumed that the final key would only be accessible to &ldquo;root&rdquo; so I started on some privilege escalation techniques. After a few different attempts I came across a copy of <code>nmap</code> that had a SUID flag set and was owned by root:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/19.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I found out that <code>nmap</code> has an interactive mode that lets you drop down into a shell, which is how I got a root shell:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/20.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I took a look at <code>/root</code> and my assumptions were validated; I had the final key:</p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/21.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/mrrobot/22.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d been meaning to take a look at this box for a while, given I&rsquo;m a big fan of the TV show. I had a lot of fun finding the different keys and it was a good box for me to practice some exploits I&rsquo;d previously learned about and used on other boxes. Thanks Leon 👍</p>
